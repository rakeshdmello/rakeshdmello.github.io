			<h4>Why Learn French?</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>French is one of the most notable languages, alongside English. It is referred to as a romantic language and is spoken by the natives of France.</li>
				<li>French have a colonial history. Just like England, they also ruled other countries and they speak French too. e.g. French is a main language in Canada. French influence can also be found in New Orleans in US.</li>
				<li>Francophone is a French speaker.</li>
				<li>Francophile is a lover of French.</li>
				<li>Before you become a francophone, you need to be a Francophile.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Tips to Learn French</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Do not over stress or overemphasize letters, words or syllables.</li>
				<li>In French, each syllable of a word has just about equal stress. When speaking, try to pronounce each syllable of a word with equal emphasis.</li>
				<li>Place slightly stronger emphasis on the last syllable of a group of words.</li>
				<li>Speak smoothly, speak musically and speak evenly. </li>
			</ul>
